Check context switches of a process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	You can view information about your process's context switches in /proc/<pid>/status.
	$ pid=307
	$ grep ctxt /proc/$pid/status
	voluntary_ctxt_switches:        41
	nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches:     16
	
Change entry point in c program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	void hello_world()
	{
		printf("Hello world\n");
		//return 0;
		_exit(0);
	}
	/* 
		return type of entry function should be void
		it should end with _exit function
		compile it using gcc -e entry_point file.c
		The -e flag changes the address of the startup code. Startup code
		has the responsibility of returning to the OS again so it can perform its
		process cleanup code and other bookkeeping stuff. 
		The test() function simply returns;
		but there is no place to return to and hence the segmentation fault.
	*/	
	/*
		If you are on a system that provides GNU Binutils (like Linux), you can use
		the objcopy command to make an arbitrary function the new entry point.
		Suppose a file called program.c containing the entry function:

		$ cat > program.c
		#include <stdio.h>
		int entry()
		{
			return 0;
		}

		You first compile it using -c to generate a relocatable object file:
			$ gcc -c program.c -o program.o
		Then you redefine entry to be main:
			$ objcopy --redefine-sym entry=main program.o
		Now use gcc to compile the new object file:
			$ gcc program.o -o program

		NOTE: If your program already has a function
		called main, before step 2, you can do a
		separate objcopy invocation:
			objcopy --redefine-sym oldmain=main program.o

	Assume that unsigned int takes 4 bytes and long int takes 8 bytes.
	O/P: struct_size.c::: error: width of ‘y’ exceeds its type

Struct 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* struct object cannot be initialized globally
	* Structure is a data type. You don't give values to a data type. You give values to instances/objects of data types.
	Below is not correct/not possible
		typedef struct
		{
			int id=0;
			char* name="none";
		}employee;

		// Do like below 
		typedef struct
		{
		   int id;
		   char* name;
		}employee;

		employee emp = {
			.id = 0 
			.name = "none"
		};
	* Structure members cannot be initialized with declaration.
	struct Point
	{
	   int x = 0;  // COMPILER ERROR:  cannot initialize members here
	   int y = 0;  // COMPILER ERROR:  cannot initialize members here
	}; 
	The reason for above error is simple, when a datatype is declared, no memory is allocated for it. 
	Memory is allocated only when variables are created.
	* Structure members can be initialized using curly braces ‘{}’.
		struct Point p1 = {0, 1}; 
	* designated Initialization 
		Point p1 = {.y = 0, .z = 1, .x = 2};
	* Structure padding occurs because the members of a structure must appear at the correct byte boundary. 
	This is more efficient at hardware level (needs less cpu cycle to read or write variables) and in some platforms this is mandatory. 
	To achieve this, the compiler puts in padding so that the structure members appear in the correct location
		
Union	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* Like Structures, union is a user defined data type. In union, all members share the same memory location. 
	union test
	{
	   int x, y;
	};
	both x and y share the same location. If we change x, we can see the changes being reflected in y.
	
	suppose we want to implement a binary tree data structure where each leaf node has a double data value, 
	while each internal node has pointers to two children, but no data. If we declare this as:
	struct NODE {
	  struct NODE *left;
	  struct NODE *right;
	  double data;
	};
	then every node requires 16 bytes, with half the bytes wasted for each type of node. 
	On the other hand, if we declare a node as following, then we can save space.
	struct NODE
	{
		bool is_leaf;
		union
		{
		    struct
		    {
		        struct NODE *left;
		        struct NODE *right;
		    } internal;
		    double data;
		} info;
	};
	
Define macro during compile time	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* -D Macro=10
	
Optimisation lavels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* O0 - do not optmize
	* O1 - reduce code size & exectime
	* O2 - opimize even more all supported options that do not involve space speed trade off
	* O3 - simple function made inline
	* Os - designed fo reduce code but not reduce speed

Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* -W - enable all the warnings during compilation
	* -Q - print each function name while compilation
	* -I - to include header file
		gcc -I ~/header/ file.c
	* -D - Define macro during compile time
		-D Macro=10
		-D Debug (gcc -D DEBUG file.c)
		#include<stdio.h>
		int main()
		{
			#ifndef DEBUG
				printf("Macro not defined\n");
			#else
				printf("Macro is Defined\n");
			#endif
		}

Static library creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* gcc -c file.c -o file.o (file which fucntioality you want to include as lib)
	ar rcs libxyz.a file.o ....(*.o)
	gcc -static -o exe main.c -L. -lxyz
		ar - Archiever
		rcs - information when, what is updated
		libxyz.z - creating library
		exe - executable file or binary
		-L. - Current location
		-lxyz - xyz is your lib name
		
Shared library creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* gcc -fPIC -c file.c
	gcc -shared -o libxyz.so *.o
	gcc -o main -L. -lxyz main.c
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
		The -fPIC option tells gcc to create position independant code which is necessary for shared libraries. 
		cc1: warning: -fPIC ignored for target (all code is position independent)
		It looks like -fPIC is not necessary on x86.
	
Gnu Debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* compile with -g option 
		gcc -g file.c
	Run debugger 
		gdb ./a.out 
	set breakpoints
		b func1
		b func2
	run/r
	step/s
	* run time shell view
		shell ls
	* gdb -silent (No info about gdb)
	* to print source lines
		list line_num
		list function_name 
		list
	* information of breakpoints
		info breakpoints n (Information of n range breakpoints)
		info break n
	* delete breakpoints
		delete breakpoints n
		disable breakpoints n
	* watchpoint
		watch "expression"
		exporession - i==7
		watch i==7 (It will search whether i is global or in memory if not give error)
	* backtrace/bt	- to get decription of all stacks
	* frame/f - brief description of current line
	* q to exit program

sizeof 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* you cannot take the address of sizeof 
	* sizeof(a++) but a will not modify
		short x;
		printf("Sizeof macro = %d\n", sizeof(x)); ----- 2
		printf("Sizeof macro = %d\n", sizeof(x+1)); --- 4
	* printf("%d", (int)sizeof('A'));
		The sizeof operator will change the 'A' to its ASCII value and 
		to the sizeof operator that ASCII value is nothing but an integer.
	* sizeof("string") = 7
		The sizeof return the number of characters including the null character
	* size of "name[0]"
		struct employee
		{
			int     emp_id;
			int     name_len;
			char    name[0];
		};
		In gcc, when we create an array of zero length, 
		it is considered as array of incomplete type that’s why gcc reports its size as “0” bytes. 
		This technique is known as “Stuct Hack”. 
		When we create array of zero length inside structure, it must be (and only) last member of structure.
		
		“Struct Hack” technique is used to create variable length member in a structure. 
		In the above structure, string length of “name” is not fixed, so we can use “name” as variable length array.
		struct employee *e = malloc(sizeof(*e) + sizeof(char) * 128); is equivalent to
		struct employee
		{
			int     emp_id;
			int     name_len;
			char    name[128]; /* character array of size 128 */
		};
		
Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		
	* a[2][] - wrong
	* a[][2] - ok
		a[][2] = { {1,2}, {3,4}};
	Array is continous if column is fixed we can increase the row will not get problem
	
Free a block of memory previously allocated without using free	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* realloc(ptr, 0))
	
#define/Macro Vs enum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	* Enum values can be automatically generated by compiler if we let it. 
		But all the define values are to be mentioned specifically. 
	* Macro is preprocessor, so unlike enum which is a compile time entity, source code has no idea about these macros. 
	So, the enum is better if we use a debugger to debug the code.
	* If we use enum values in a switch and the default case is missing, some compiler will give a warning.
	* Enum always makes identifiers of type int. But the macro let us choose between different integral types.
	* Two enum names can have same value. The enum can contain only the constant value.
	* All enum constants must be unique in their scope. Enums follow scope rules.
		enum state  {working, failed}; enum result {failed, passed};
		int main()  { return 0; }
		o/p: Compile Error: 'failed' has a previous declaration as 'state failed'
	* Macro does not specifically maintain scope restriction unlike enum. 
	
malloc(0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	* According to C standard, “ If the size of the space requested is zero, 
	the behavior is implementation defined: either a null pointer is returned, 
	or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value, 
	except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object”. 
	But there is a benefit of this. 
	The pointer return after malloc(0) will be valid pointer and can be deallocated using free() and it will not crash the program.

Operators Precedence	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reading C type declarations	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	* http://unixwiz.net/techtips/reading-cdecl.html
	
Extern	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	1. Declaration can be done any number of times but definition only once.
	2. “extern” keyword is used to extend the visibility of variables/functions().
	3. Since functions are visible through out the program by default.
		The use of extern is not needed in function declaration/definition. Its use is redundant.
	4. When extern is used with a variable, it’s only declared not defined.
	5. As an exception, when an extern variable is declared with initialization, it is taken as definition of the variable as well.
	
	Scenario 1:
		extern int var;
		int main(void) {
			var = 10;return 0;
		}
	Analysis: This program throws error in compilation. 
		Because var is declared but not defined anywhere. 
		Essentially, the var isn’t allocated any memory And the program is trying to change the value to 10 of a variable that doesn’t exist at all.
	if Supposing that somefile.h has the definition of var. This program will be compiled successfully.

	Scenario 2:	
		extern int var = 0;
		int main(void) {
			var = 10;return 0;
		}
	They say that..if a variable is only declared and an initializer is also provided with that declaration, 
	then the memory for that variable will be allocated i.e. that variable will be considered as defined.
	
Variable Declaration and Scope		
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	* A variable declared in a block is accessible in the block and all inner blocks of that block, but not accessible outside the block.
	What if the inner block itself has one variable with the same name?
		If an inner block declares a variable with the same name as the variable declared by the outer block, 
		then the visibility of the outer block variable ends at the pint of declaration by inner block.
	* i) int var_9 = 1;
		ii) int 9_var = 2;
		iii) int _ = 3;
	In C language, a variable name can consists of letters, digits and underscore i.e. _ . 
	But a variable name has to start with either letter or underscore. 
	It can't start with a digit. So valid variables are var_9 and _ from the above question. 
	Even two back to back underscore i.e. __ is also a valid variable name. 
	Even _9 is a valid variable. But 9var and 9_ are invalid variables in C. 
	This will be caught at the time of compilation itself. That's why the correct answer is A).

call by value and call by reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	int i ;
	program main ()
	{
		int j = 60;
		i = 50;
		call f (i, j);
		print i, j;
	}
	procedure f (x, y)
	{           
		i = 100;
		x = 10;
		y = y + i ;
	}
	
	Call by value : i = 100, j = 60; Call by reference : i = 10, j = 7
	
C allows a global variable to be declared again when first declaration doesn’t initialize the variable.	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	int x;
	int x = 5;
	 
	int main()
	{
	   printf("%d", x);
	   return 0; 
	}
	O/P: 5 

Void pointer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	int main()
	{
		void *vptr, v;
		v = 0;
		vptr = &v;
		printf("%v", *vptr);
		getchar();
		return 0;
	}
	O/P: void is not a valid type for declaring variables. void * is valid though.

Comparision with signed var	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main()
	{
		if (sizeof(int) > -1)
		    printf("Yes");
		else
		    printf("No");
		return 0;
	}
	In C, when an intger value is compared with an unsigned it, the int is promoted to unsigned. 
	Negative numbers are stored in 2's complement form and unsigned value of the 2's complement form is much higher than the sizeof int.

Pointer Arithmetic (Computation of Ptr2 - Ptr1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	struct test
	{
		unsigned int x; unsigned int k;	long int y: 25;
	//    long int k: 64;
		unsigned int z;
	};
	int main()
	{
		struct test t;
		unsigned int *ptr1 = &t.x; unsigned int *ptr2 = &t.z;
		printf("%p\n", ptr1); printf("%p\n", ptr2);
		printf("%ld\n", ptr2 - ptr1);
		return 0;
	}
	Final Result  = (ptr2 - ptr1) / Size of Data Type

Interesting Facts about Bitwise Operators in C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	* The left shift and right shift operators should not be used for negative numbers
	* The bitwise operators should not be used in-place of logical operators.
		int main()
		{
		   int x = 2, y = 5;
		   (x & y)? printf("True ") : printf("False ");
		   (x && y)? printf("True ") : printf("False ");
		   return 0;
		}
		// Output: False True
	* The left-shift and right-shift operators are equivalent to multiplication and division by 2 respectively.
	
Understanding “register” keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	* Registers are faster than memory to access, so the variables which are most frequently used in a C program 
	can be put in registers using register keyword. 
	The keyword register hints to compiler that a given variable can be put in a register. 
	It’s compiler’s choice to put it in a register or not.
	* Accessing address of a register is invalid
		  register int i = 10; int *a = &i; 
	* Register keyword can be used with pointer variables.	
		register int *a = &i;
	* Register is a storage class, and C doesn’t allow multiple storage class specifiers for a variable. 
	So, register can not be used with static .
	  register static int *a = &i;
	* When we go for Register storage class : Simply to make the execution fast and to utilize the microprocessor's 
	register memory we use register variable. 
	* In some situations like :
		1. for frequently used variable ,such as loop control variable.
		2. If we need a local variable and nowhere in program need of that's address, on that situation we specifies that variable as register.
		3. If you want to specify the storage class of formal argument then you can only use register storage class.
	* Limitations of that variable : If we specify as register to variable then that have some limitations like :
		1. we can't declare that objects globally,
		2. we can't apply & operator on that object.
	  
Typedef is storage class specifier	  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		
	* The typedef specifier does not reserve storage and is called a storage class specifier.
	* typedef doesn't declare an instance of a variable, it declares a type (type alias actually), 
	static is a qualifier you apply to an instance, not a type, so you can use static when you use the type, but not when you define the type. 
	Like this..
		typedef int int32;
		static int32 foo;

What is preprocessor ? What will the preprocessor do for the program?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		
	* The preprocessor is a stage at which it modifies the program(extends the source code ) 
	according to the preprocessor directives in your source code.
	
	The preprocessor provides different facilities :
		1.file inclusion : #include replace the current line with the contents
		2.Strip comments : It removes all the comments from the source code.
		3.Macro Expansion :	All the macro invocations are replaced with	the text defined with the #define directives.
		4.Conditional Compilation: Preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude, parts of the the program according to the condition.
			#ifdef MAX
				printf(“hello”);
			#endif
		5. # pragma directive
	* Preprocessor Error Directive (#error):- 
		The #error macro allows you to make compilation fail and issue a statement that will appear in the list of compilation errors. It is most 
		useful when combined with #if/#elif/#else to fail compilation if some condition is not true.
		For example:
		#ifndef __unix__ // __unix__ is typically defined when targetting Unix
			#error "Only Unix is supported"
		#endif

What is the benefit of using an enum rather than a #defined constant ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		
	* Enumerated constants are generated by the compiler automatically , but macros must be manually assigned values by the programmer.
	* All #defined constants are global while enum obeys the scope rules .
	* Readability enhances by using enum than using macros .
	* Macro substituted at compile time(pre processing stage ) while enum is processed at run time.

Explain Stringizing operator with respect to preprocessor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		
	* The stringizing operator is used to convert prameters passed to macro into strings.
		The symbol is “#”
	* The stringizing operator used with #define preprocessor directives taking a parameter.
		#define MAKE_STRING (x) #x
		Will convert whatever is passed as parameter “x” into string
		Leading and trailing white spaces are deleted.

Explain the difference between break and continue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* Break statement may appear in an iteration statement or in switch statement 
	but continue statement may appear in only iteration statement.
	* Break statement terminate the execution of the smallest enclosing such statement(Iteration or switch statements), 
	but it skip the sub statements below itself (of iteration statements) and continues the iteration.
	In Iteration statements:
	do {
		statement1;
		if (condition_1) {
			statement2;
			break;
		} else {
			statement3;
			continue;
		}
	} while (condition_2);
	explanation : in first iteration it will executes statement 1 then check condition_1 if it results some non zero value 
	then- execute statement 2 and comes out of loopif condition_1 false then- it goes for else part run statement 3 
	and the check condition_2 if it is resulting nonzero value then loop will run again.

What is inline function? How it is different from macros.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* Inline function is a normal function preceded with a keyword inline. 
	When a call is made to the inline function, the actual code is substituted or expanded in the function call statement in the program.
	* Macros does not return value, but inline function always return.
	* inline performed strict type checking but macros does not perform type cheking.
	* Usage of macros is always replaced with actual code (i.e. they are always in lined) While its up to the compiler to decide 
	whether to replace the inline function call to function code or keep it as function call.
	* macros dont make the part of Code Segment, but inline functions are a part of code segment.

Variable Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and 
	the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
	* Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
	* Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. 
	The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
	* Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
	* Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdarg.h>
	double average(int num,...) {
	   va_list valist;
	   double sum = 0.0;
	   int i;
	   va_start(valist, num); 											/* initialize valist for num number of arguments */
	   for (i = 0; i < num; i++) { sum += va_arg(valist, int); } 	   	/* access all the arguments assigned to valist */
	   va_end(valist);						   							/* clean memory reserved for valist */
	   return sum/num;
	}
	int main() { printf("Average of 2, 3, 4, 5 = %f\n", average(4, 2,3,4,5)); }

Error (function declaration isn’t a prototype)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* In C int foo() and int foo(void) are different functions. 
	int foo() accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, while int foo(void) accepts 0 arguments.
	
	Errro (Undefined reference to `pow' and `floor')
	* gcc file_name.c -lm
	This will tell gcc to link your code against the math lib. Just be sure to put the flag after the objects you want to link.
